## 📌 Overview

This interactive weather dashboard was developed as my final year capstone project for FIT3164 – Data Science Project at Monash University. The goal was to create an intuitive, visually rich platform that allows users to explore historical and recent weather trends across Australia, including temperature and rainfall data. The dashboard provides valuable insights for climate awareness, decision-making, and data exploration.
